# Governance Stack - Backend

Backend services for the Starknet governance application, including indexing, databases, and REST API.

## Architecture

This repository contains the core governance backend services:

- **db**: PostgreSQL database for governance data (proposals, votes, delegates)
- **indexer**: Apibara-based indexer for OpenZeppelin Governor events
- **api**: Custom Express REST API serving governance data only

### Separate Repositories & Services

- **swaps-indexer + swaps-db + swaps-api**: Deployed separately in its own repository with its own database and API
- **ui**: Frontend deployed separately (Vercel/Netlify)

### Architecture Benefits

This split architecture provides:
- **Performance**: Governance queries are fast and not impacted by swap data volume
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently
- **Reliability**: Governance remains available even if swaps service has issues
- **Maintenance**: Simpler to manage, backup, and optimize each service separately
- **Deployment**: Independent deployment cycles for each service

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Apibara DNA token (get from https://app.apibara.com/)
- Your Starknet contract addresses

### Setup

1. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your values:**
   ```bash
   DNA_TOKEN=dna_your_actual_token_here
   GOVERNOR_ADDRESS=0x...
   VOTES_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
   ```

3. **Start all backend services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

5. **Services will be running at:**
   - API: http://localhost:4000
   - Governance DB: localhost:5432

   **Note**: The UI is deployed separately (configure it to point to your API URL)

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Fresh start (removes all data)
docker-compose down -v

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f indexer
docker-compose logs -f api
```

## Production Deployment

This repository deploys only the governance backend services. The swaps services and ui are deployed separately.

### Railway Deployment (Governance Backend)

Deploy these 3 services to Railway:
1. **PostgreSQL database** (governance data only)
2. **Governance indexer** (from this GitHub repo)
3. **Governance API** (from this GitHub repo)

For detailed deployment instructions, see **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

### External Service Configuration

**Swaps Services** (separate repository):
- Deploy swaps-indexer + swaps-db + swaps-api in a separate Railway project or repository
- These services handle all swap and price data independently

**Governance UI** (deployed on Vercel/Netlify):
- Set environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.railway.app`

**API CORS Configuration**:
- Update `CORS_ORIGIN` to allow your UI domain: `CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-ui-domain.vercel.app`

## API Endpoints

The governance API provides the following endpoints:

### Governance
- `GET /api/governance/proposals` - List all proposals
- `GET /api/governance/proposals/:id` - Get proposal details
- `GET /api/governance/proposals/:id/votes` - Get votes for a proposal
- `GET /api/governance/proposals/:id/calls` - Get proposal actions
- `GET /api/governance/delegates` - List all delegates
- `GET /api/governance/delegates/:address` - Get delegate info
- `GET /api/governance/delegations/:address` - Get delegation info
- `GET /api/governance/stats/total-votes` - Get total voting power
- `GET /api/governance/votes/address/:address` - Get votes by voter address

See `api/README.md` for detailed API documentation.

**Note**: Swaps/price data is served by a separate API deployed with the swaps-indexer.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for a complete list of environment variables. Key variables include:

### Apibara
- `DNA_TOKEN`: Apibara authentication token
- `APIBARA_URL`: Apibara DNA stream URL (default: mainnet.starknet.a5a.ch)

### Governance
- `GOVERNOR_ADDRESS`: Governor contract address
- `VOTES_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: ERC20Votes token address

### Indexer
- `STARTING_CURSOR_BLOCK_NUMBER`: Block to start indexing from (0 = genesis)
- `NO_BLOCKS_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for block streaming (0 = disabled)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Log level (debug/info/warn/error)

### API
- `PORT`: API server port (default: 4000)
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: Allowed CORS origin
- Cache TTLs for different data types

### UI
- `VITE_API_URL`: API server URL (default: http://localhost:4000)

**Note**: `swaps-indexer`, `swaps-api`, and `swaps-db` are maintained in a separate repository.

## Testing the API

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# Get all proposals
curl http://localhost:4000/api/governance/proposals | jq

# Get specific proposal
curl http://localhost:4000/api/governance/proposals/1 | jq

# Get votes for a proposal
curl http://localhost:4000/api/governance/proposals/1/votes | jq

# Get all delegates
curl http://localhost:4000/api/governance/delegates | jq

# Get total voting power
curl http://localhost:4000/api/governance/stats/total-votes | jq
```

## Development

### Running Individual Services

Each service can be developed and tested independently:

**Governance API:**
```bash
cd api
npm install
npm run dev  # Runs on port 4000
```

**Governance Indexer:**
```bash
cd indexer
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Governance UI:**
The UI is maintained in a separate repository/deployment. See that repository's README for local development instructions.

### Database Access

Connect to local governance database:

```bash
# Governance database
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mainnet
```

## Troubleshooting

### Indexer Not Syncing

**Symptoms:** No data appearing in database, indexer logs show errors

**Solutions:**
- Check `DNA_TOKEN` is valid and not expired
- Verify contract addresses are correct
- Ensure `STARTING_CURSOR_BLOCK_NUMBER` is valid
- Check Apibara service status

```bash
docker-compose logs indexer
```

### API Connection Errors

**Symptoms:** UI can't fetch data, API returns 500 errors

**Solutions:**
- Verify governance database is running and healthy
- Check `GOVERNANCE_DB_URL` is correct
- Ensure governance indexer has populated the governance database

```bash
docker-compose ps  # Check service status
docker-compose logs api
```

### Slow Indexing

**Symptoms:** Governance indexer taking a long time to catch up

**Solutions:**
- This is expected if starting from genesis
- Consider setting `STARTING_CURSOR_BLOCK_NUMBER` to a more recent block (e.g., when your governor was deployed)
- Check database disk space and performance
- Verify the indexer isn't being rate-limited by Apibara

### Fresh Start

If you need to completely reset and start over:

```bash
# Stop all services and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Edit .env if needed
nano .env

# Start fresh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Contributing
